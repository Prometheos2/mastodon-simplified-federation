This add-on makes it easier for you to follow or interact with other users on remote instances. Basically, it skips the "Enter your Mastodon handle" interface and takes you directly to your own "home" instance, when you click on a "Follow" button or a reply/retoot/fav button on another instance.


<b>Why?</b>
You may wonder why to use this browser add-on. But actually, it's easy!

You do not need to enter your Mastodon account handle anymore! (except for login ;) ) This makes interacting with remote instances much simpler.

Additionally, this add-on makes sure to keep your Mastodon handle <b>private</b>. It will never expose it into any third-party site. As such, e.g., it does not – literally – enter your Mastodon ID into the input field you normally see, but basically "skips" this page. For the technical details, on how this works, see <a href="https://github.com/rugk/mastodon-simplified-federation#how-does-it-work" title="How does it work?">the detailed explanation on GitHub</a>.


<b>How to use?</b>
After you have installed the add-on, you need to go into the settings, enter your Mastodon handle (that is <code>username@server</code>). After this is done, there is nothing to do anymore.
It will continue to work in the background and you do not need to do anything.
Just enjoy the simplified federation


<b>What is Mastodon?</b>
Mastodon is a new and friendly social network that is decentralized. To be exact, it is "federated" meaning you can be on one server and follow another user on a different server.
For that, you usually need to enter your Mastodon ID on the "foreign" server. This add-on removes this step.
